Here I provide couple of scripts that I have used in my master thesis.

The main intention of the scripts are the following:

-To generate artificial data by using ABAQUS Python API.
-To do EDA (exploratory data analysis)
-To train ML (machine learning) models and make predictions
-To perform optimization with GA (genetic algorithm) -> Note this code is not belong to me, it is taken from somewhere on the internet.
