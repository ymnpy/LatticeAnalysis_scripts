Here I provide couple of scripts that I have used in my master thesis.


The main intention of the scripts are the following:

-To generate artificial data by using ABAQUS Python API

-To do EDA (exploratory data analysis)

-To train ML (machine learning) models and make predictions about mechanical properties

-To perform optimization with GA (genetic algorithm, note that GA code is not belong to me, it is taken from somewhere on the internet.)


Note: The code has comments here and there, because sometimes I brute forced my way out of it to accomplish what I needed, so it is up to the user fix those lines. Use it wisely.
